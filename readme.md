## üéØ User Guide

The Servo App API is designed to offer users an effortless experience in locating nearby petrol stations based on their geographical location. For developers or administrators looking to integrate or set up the application, the below guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to get you up and running.

### 1. Acquire Necessary API Keys

The Servo App leverages various APIs to ensure optimal functionality. To make the most of its features, it's essential to secure and input the required API keys.

#### [Google Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps)

Input your Google Map API key into the dedicated script tag found in the index.html within the clients directory.

```
<script async
 src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR-API-KEY&callback=initMap"
></script>

```

#### [Futures API](https://www.futures-api.com/documentation)

Input your Futures API key into latest_prices.js, situated inside the components folder within the clients directory.

```
const apiKey = "YOUR-FUTURES-API-KEY";
```

### 2. Database Setup

We've chosen PostgreSQL as our database solution for its reliability and scalability. Follow the below steps for database setup:

- **Database Creation** - Create a new PostgreSQL database named servo_app.
- **Table Setup** - Construct a table named stations. You can reference the schema (data.sql) provided in the db directory to ensure correct fields and data types.
- **Data Seeding** - Populate the stations table using the stations.csv file. This can be achieved with the following command:

```
\copy stations FROM '/db/stations.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

### 3. Launch & Explore
